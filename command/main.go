// Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
// The Command pattern suggests that GUI objects shouldnâ€™t send these requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request details,
// such as the object being Doed, the name of the method and the list of arguments into a separate command class with a single method that triggers this request.
